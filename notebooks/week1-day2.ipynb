      "The capital of India is New Delhi. It serves as the seat of the federal government and is one of the most prominent cities in South Asia, known for its historical landmarks like the Rashtrapati Bhavan (the parliament building) and the India Gate military cenotaph monument. The city was designed by British architects Herbert Baker and Edwin Lutyens during colonial times but took on a life of its own with Indian influence, becoming an amalgamation that reflects both European sensibty in urban planning as well as traditional aspects central to India's heritage. New Delhi is also home to the Red Fort (Lal Qila), which was once inhabited by Mughal emperors and now functions largely for touristic purposes due to its significant historical importance, exemplifying a blend of various architectural influences throughout Indian history including Islamic, Persian, and European styles. Additionally, understanding New Delhi as the political heart allows one to appreciate how it is also central in cultural matters; with every year's Republic Day parade presenting not just India’s military might but its rich diversity of traditions such as music, dance, fashion—each segment representing various cultures and languages making up this vibrant society.\n"
